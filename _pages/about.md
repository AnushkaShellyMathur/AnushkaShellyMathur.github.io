Welcome to my portfolio!
I am Anushka Shelly Mathur, a dedicated scholar, versatile software developer, creative UI/UX designer, and passionate content writer. My enthusiasm for mentoring and engaging in meaningful discussions drives my professional journey.

If you’re a fellow 'Ted Lasso' fan or share a love for the horror genre, we’ll have plenty to chat about! I strive to follow the principles outlined in the book "And how do you feel about that" in all my interactions, ensuring thoughtful and empathetic communication.
